A new reporter hook ``resolving_conflicts`` is added. The resolver triggers
this hook when it detects conflicts in the dependency tree, and before it
attempts to fix them. The hook accepts one single argument ``causes``, which
is a list of ``(requirement, parent)`` 2-tuples that represents all the
edges that lead to the detected conflicts.
