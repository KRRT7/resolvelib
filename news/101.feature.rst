A new reporter hook ``rejecting_candidate`` is added, replacing the former
``backtracking`` one. The resolver triggers this hook every time it rejects
a conflicting package before trying out an older version of it.
The hook accepts two arguments: ``criterion`` (a ``resolvers.Criterion``
object) and ``candidate``.
