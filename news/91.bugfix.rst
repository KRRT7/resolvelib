Some valid states that were previously rejected are now accepted. This affects
states where multiple candidates for the same dependency conflict with each
other. The ``information`` argument passed to
``AbstractProvider.get_preference`` may now contain empty iterators. This has
always been allowed by the method definition but it was previously not possible
in practice.
